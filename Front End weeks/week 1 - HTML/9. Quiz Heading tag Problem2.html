    <h2>Intersting fact</h2>
    <p>
        The first of two cinematic parts, the film follows Sivudu, an adventurous young man who helps his love

        The film's story was written by Rajamouli's father V. Vijayendra Prasad, who randomly told him a story about Sivagami, 
        a woman who carries a baby in her hand while crossing a river, and a few years later about Kattappa, 
        which intrigued Rajamouli. His fascination with Mahabharata and the tales of Amar Chitra Katha and Chandamama
        further fuelled his interest in the story. However, it took the writers three months to complete the final draft. 
        The soundtrack and background score were composed by M. M. Keeravani while the cinematography, production design, 
        and VFX were handled by K. K. Senthil Kumar, Sabu Cyril and V. Srinivas Mohan respectively.
