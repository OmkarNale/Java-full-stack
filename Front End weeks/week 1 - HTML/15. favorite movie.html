        <h3>Movie description :</h3>
        <p>
            Baahubali: The Beginning is a 2015 Indian epic action film co-written and directed by S. S. Rajamouli, and 
            produced by Shobu Yarlagadda and Prasad Devineni under Arka Media Works. The film was produced in Tollywood,
            the centre of Telugu language films in India and was filmed in both Telugu and Tamil languages simultaneously. 
             The first of two cinematic parts, the film follows Sivudu, an adventurous young man who helps 
            his love Avantika rescue Devasena, the former queen of Mahishmati who is now a prisoner under the tyrannical rule 
            of king Bhallaladeva. The story concludes in Baahubali 2: The Conclusion.

            The film's story was written by Rajamouli's father V. Vijayendra Prasad, who randomly told him a story about Sivagami,
            a woman who carries a baby in her hand while crossing a river, and a few years later about Kattappa, which intrigued 
            Rajamouli. His fascination with Mahabharata and the tales of Amar Chitra Katha and Chandamama further fuelled his 
            interest in the story. However, it took the writers three months to complete the final draft. The soundtrack and 
            background score were composed by M. M. Keeravani while the cinematography, production design, and VFX were handled 
            by K. K. Senthil Kumar, Sabu Cyril and V. Srinivas Mohan respectively.
